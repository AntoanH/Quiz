Question3:
What will happen when you compile and run the following code?
public class Test{
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		
		double d1 = Double.NaN;		
		double d2 = d1;
		
		if(d1 == d2)
			System.out.println("Equal");
		else
			System.out.println("Not Equal");
	}
	
}
0. Equal
1. Not Equal
2. The code will not compile
3. The code will compile but will throw run time error
Multiple choice answer (1 or more choices are correct)
Example (only one correct): 1
Example (two correct): 1 3

Question4:
Associate keywords with their definitions
0. abstract
1. interface
2. static
3. void


a. can be used on fields or methods, indicating that this field/method is held by the class definition. When placed on a field, the value is shared by all instances of that class
b. can be used on class or method definitions, means that a part of the implementation will be assumed by descending classes
c. defines a behavior or a meta-class, allowing to generify the code and to change the implementation if needed
d. used as a method return type, indicates that the method returns no value
Associative answers (match every keyword with description for ex. 0a 2b 3d 1c)
